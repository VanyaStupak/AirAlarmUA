# dev.devlight.skeleton

## Overview

This module encapsulates common build configurations, conventions, and standards, promoting
uniformity and best practices throughout the development process.

To improve code maintenance, a number of plugins have been developed.

They are grouped by subject area:

- Android application [+Compose];
- Android features [+Compose];
- Android tests (aka integration tests);
- Kotlin library;
- Unit tests;
- some other plugins for code smell reducing.

## Implementation details

### Convention plugins

#### Android

##### AndroidApplicationConventionPlugin/AndroidApplicationComposeConventionPlugin

Facilitates the development of Android applications, with built-in support for Jetpack Compose.

##### AndroidFeatureConventionPlugin/AndroidFeatureComposeConventionPlugin

Supports the creation of modular Android features, incorporating Jetpack Compose for modern UI

potential issues early in the development cycle.
Customizable rules and configurations to match your projectâ€™s specific requirements.

##### KtlintConventionPlugin

Incorporates Ktlint for Kotlin code formatting, ensuring a consistent coding style across your
project.
Automatically formats code and highlights deviations from the defined coding standards.

##### DokkaConventionPlugin
